## About

 This project demonstrates a means by which to dynamically add links to a navigation menu based on the number of content sections in the main HTML file. Through DOM manipulation, links to each of these respective sections are automatically added to the navigation bar. These links also take on an 'active' state upon selection, indicating to the user the choice they have last made.
